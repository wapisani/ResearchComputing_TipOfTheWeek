Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the choice OS for work stations, while Rocks Cluster distribution is the choice OS for high performance computing and visualization clusters. As has been a common practice for several years now, a full version of operating system was installed in work stations as well as HPC/HPV clusters used to test these scripts, tools, utilities, procedures, etc.,.  

These scripts, tools, utilities, procedures, etc., may very well work for you (or your institution) on your work stations, Rocks/Rocks-like and/or other linux clusters. Please note that if you decide to use them, you are doing so entirely at your very own discretion, and that Michigan Technological University is not responsible for any/all damage(s) -- intellectual and/or otherwise.      

Please feel free to download, edit these scripts, tools, utilities and make them dance to your heart's content. If you are feeling generous, contribute back to the repository.
