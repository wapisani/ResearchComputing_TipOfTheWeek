The scripts, tools, utilities, procedures, etc., included in this repository were written by and have been tested at Michigan Technological University to help our researchers. These are published, often periodically, as Tip of The Week at

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x is the choice OS for work stations, while Rocks Cluster distribution (6.1.1 with CentOS 6.3) is the choice OS for HPC clusters. As has been a common practice for several years now, a full version of operating system was installed in work stations as well as HPC clusters used to test these scripts, tools, utilities, procedures, etc.,.  

These scripts, tools, utilities, procedures, etc., may very well work for you (or your institution) on your work stations, Rocks/Rocks-like and/or other linux clusters. Please note that if you decide to use them, you are doing so entirely at your very own discretion and that Michigan Technological University is not responsible for any/all damage(s) -- intellectual and/or otherwise.      

Please feel free to download, edit these scripts, tools, utilities and make them dance to your heart's content. If you feel generous enough, contribute back to the repository.
